# Public Blogging

Time for something new. 

I've been blogging at a private wiki for quite a while, but a lot of the
information I find could be useful to others so I'll try a public version
and see how it goes.

This blog will mostly be about HPC computing and the transition from 
traditional batch systems to OpenStack, development of new microservice
archiectures rather than stodgy old CMS systems, and I might touch on 
GIS, data visualization, and urban modeling along the way.
