# Hello!

My name is Jeff Terstriep. I'm the president of [LEAMgroup, Inc.](http://leamgroup.com), a small technology spin-off company that has developed an urban growth model and provides the software to city and regional planners to help them understand the impact of growth in their area. I'm also working with CyberGIS group at NCSA/University of Illinois.
